      <description>I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at the Wireless Communication Section at the Aalborg University, Denmark. The PhD project focuses on detecting phishing domains early in their lifecycle. My research interest include network security, the analysis of the Internet at large and have a curiosity for machine learning. In addition, I have been involved in the development of the (soon to be) open-source Haaukins platform, a virtualization platform used for the education of information security.</description>
