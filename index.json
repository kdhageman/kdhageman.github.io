Any DNS-based security system is ineffective against malicious content distributed through this traffic. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying unnamed traffic based on the correlation of flows and DNS responses extracted from raw network traces. We describe two challenges that affect the validity of our method, and how to handle them. By applying our method to a one-week trace of network traffic, we illustrate that unnamed traffic is ubiquitous in a university network across nearly all client systems, destination IP addresses, and destination services. We conclude by presenting several open problems that prevent us from blocking unnamed traffic for security reasons.","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the Challenges of Blocking Unnamed Network Traffic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sajad Homayoun","Kaspar Hageman","Sam Afzal-Houshmand,","Christian Damsgaard Jensen,","Jens Myrup Pedersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642809600,"objectID":"29a37a762181394510c7ac7a6a0203b2","permalink":"https://hageman.dk/publication/ambiguous_phish/","publishdate":"2022-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ambiguous_phish/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent phishing attacks have started to migrate to HTTP over TLS (HTTPS), making a phishing web page appear safe to the user’s browser despite its malicious purpose. This paper benefits from both digital certificates and domains related data features to propose machine learning-based solutions to predict digital certificates involved in HTTPS as phishing or benign certificates. In contrast to previous works that consider this a binary classification problem, we take into account that a certificate can be partially benign and phishy simultaneously. We propose a multi-class classifier and a regressor to classify these ambiguous certificates, in addition to benign and phishing certificates, where the ‘phishyness’ of a certificate is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 for the regressor. We apply our method to a set of certificates obtained from certificate transparency logs and show that we can classify them with high performance. We extend our validation by evaluating the performance of the model over time, showing that our model generalizes over time on our training data set.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting Ambiguous Phishing Certificates using Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaspar Hageman","René Rydhof Hansen","Jens Myrup Pedersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636761600,"objectID":"e4d9d9b92f73abeb435b445c830d53ac","permalink":"https://hageman.dk/publication/gollector/","publishdate":"2021-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gollector/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes Gollector, a novel tool for measuring the domain name space from different vantage points.

To close the skill gap, there is a need for introducing students in higher education to cyber security, and to combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills. This paper presents how the cyber security training platform Haaukins, initially developed to increase interest and knowledge of cyber security among high school students, was further developed to support the need for training in higher education. Based on the differences between the existing and new target audiences, a set of design principles were derived which shaped the technical adjustments required to provide a suitable platform - mainly related to dynamic tooling, centralized access to exercises, and scalability of the platform to support courses running over longer periods of time. The implementation of these adjustments has led to a series of teaching sessions in various institutions of higher education, demonstrating the viability for Haaukins for the new target audience.","tags":[],"title":"Bridging the Gap: Adapting a Security Education Platform to a New Audience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaspar Hageman","Egon Kidmose","René Rydhof Hansen","Jens Myrup Pedersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623110400,"objectID":"c24a0f9784679f39c8cd76e2e0d19ba1","permalink":"https://hageman.dk/publication/phishy_cert/","publishdate":"2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phishy_cert/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates the potential of using digital certificates for the detection of phishing domains. This is motivated by phishing domains that have started to abuse the (erroneous) trust of the public in browser padlock symbols, and by the large-scale adoption of the Certificate Transparency (CT) framework. This publicly accessible evidence trail of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates has made the TLS landscape more transparent than ever. By comparing samples of phishing, popular benign, and non-popular benign domains, we provide insight into the TLS certificates issuance behavior for phishing domains, focusing on the selection of the certificate authority, the validation level of the certificates, and the phenomenon of certificate sharing among phishing domains. Our results show that phishing domains gravitate to a relatively small selection of certificate authorities, and disproportionally to cPanel, and tend to rely on certificates with a low, and cheap, validation level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the vast majority of certificates issued for phishing domains cover more than only phishing domains. These results suggest that a more pro-active role of CAs and putting more emphasis on certificate revocation can have a crucial impact in the defense against phishing attacks.","tags":[],"title":"Can a TLS Certificate be Phishy?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaspar Hageman","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Security flaws in DNS led to a major overhaul, with the introduction of the DNS security (DNSSEC) extensions. DNSSEC adds integrity and authenticity to the DNS using digital signatures. DNSSEC, however, has its own concerns. It suffers from availability problems due to packet fragmentation and is a potent source of distributed denial-of-service attacks. In earlier work, we argued that many issues with DNSSEC stem from the choice of RSA as default signature algorithm. A switch to alternatives based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can resolve these issues. Yet switching to ECC introduces a new problem: ECC signature validation is much slower than RSA validation. Thus, switching DNSSEC to ECC imposes a significant additional burden on DNS resolvers, pushing load toward the edges of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we study the question: will switching DNSSEC to ECC lead to problems for DNS resolvers, or can they handle the extra load? To answer this question, we developed a model that accurately predicts how many signature validations DNS resolvers have to perform. This allows us to calculate the additional CPU load ECC imposes on a resolver. Using real-world measurements from four DNS resolvers and with two open-source DNS implementations, we evaluate future scenarios where DNSSEC is universally deployed. Our results conclusively show that switching DNSSEC to ECC signature schemes does not impose an insurmountable load on DNS resolvers, even in worst case scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"The Performance Impact of Elliptic Curve Cryptography on DNSSEC Validation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
